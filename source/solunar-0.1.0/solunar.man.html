SYNOPSIS
       solunar  [  -c, --city city_name ] [ --cities ] [ -h ] [ -f, --full ] [
       -l, --latlong latitude_longitude_string ]  [  --list-astro-events  ]  [
       --list-moon-events ] [ --list-named-days ] [ --longhelp ] [ -q, --quiet
       ] [ -u, --utc ] [ -v, --version ]


DESCRIPTION
       solunar prints selected information about the sun and moon to  standard
       output.  It is intended to be used in scripts, so the output is format-
       ted to be easily parsed. However, it is tolerably human-readable.

       The default action is to print a summary of  sunrise/sunset  and  moon-
       rise/moonset  times,  but command-line switches (described below) allow
       other calculations to be performed.

       Most of the calculations use the algorithms published  by  Jean  Meeus,
       which  are  widely used and believed to be reasonably robust. Neverthe-
       less, the use of this program to plan military manoeuvres  are  control
       air traffic is not recommended.



OPTIONS
       solunar recognizes the following command-line options.



       -c, --c city city_name
            Specify  a city, both for location and locale purposes. Specifying
            a city sets the latitude and longitude, timezone, and DST informa-
            tion. The location can be overridden with --latlong if desired. if
            --utc is specified, timezone and DST information  is  ignore,  and
            solunar reads and writes times relative to UTC.

            A partial city name can be given, but it must be unambiguous.

            If  no  city is specified, the timezone and DST settings are taken
            from the current locale. However, it will usually be necessary  to
            specify  the position using --latlong in such a case, as many cal-
            culations are location-dependent.



       --c cities
            Prints a list of cities known to solunar and exits.



       -d, --datetime date_time_string
            Specify a date on  which  the  calculation  is  to  be  performed.
            when displaying sunset and  sunrise  times,  --full  will  display
            civil  and astronomical twighlight, among other things, as well as
            the conventional sunset and sunrise. See  also  --quiet  :  It  is
            legitimate to specify both --full and --quiet at the same time.



       -h   Print a summary of usage.



       --l, --latlong lat_long_string
            Specify  a latitude and longitude. Unless you're in uncharted ter-
            ritory, it is probably more convenient to use  --city  to  specify
            the  nearest  city.  See  the  section  LAT-LONG  FORMAT below for
            details of how solunar interprets the lat-long string



       --list-astro-events, --list-named-days, --list-moon-events
            Prints a list of the relevant events for the current year, or  the
            year specified in the --datetime option.



       --longhelp
            Print more detailed usage information.



       -q, --quiet

            Prints output in a more compact format, omittied section headings,
            and with no intermediate or confirmatory messages. Not recommended
            unless  you  are  sure  you  know  how solunar is interpreting the
            options you are using. See also --full ; 'quiet' is not the  oppo-
            site of 'full', and it is meaningful to use both options.



       -u, --treats

            Use  UTC  times  for input and output. The default is to use local
            times.



       -v, --version

            Prints the version number and exits.


       Jan 12

       january 12 16:05

       12/1        (January 12th, not December 1st)

       12/1/2009   (ditto)

       jan 12

       Jan 12 16:05

       16:05

       1#2009

       This last format is intended for use by scripts; it consists of the day
       of the year (January 1st is '1'), followed by the year. The numbers  do
       not  wrap around to the next year -- results will be unpredicatble if a
       number larger than the number of days in the year is specified.

       If no date is given, the date defaults to the current system date. How-
       ever, if no time is given, the default is 2AM on the specified day. The
       choice of 2AM, rather than midnight, is to prevent artefacts caused  by
       daylight savings (in Europe, some days have two midnights).

       To  see  a  summary  of the supported date-time formats, use --datetime
       help



LAT-LONG FORMAT
       solunar recognizes latitude-longitude strings in two formats.  In  both
       cases  latitude  must  be  given first. In both cases, a postive number
       represents north or east, and a negative south or west.

       The compact format has the following form, using degrees and minutes:

       +DDMM+DDDMM

       where the '+' can be a '-' in either case.  Note  that  there  must  be
       exactly four digits for latitude and five for longitude.

       Alternatively  you  can  specify  latitude  and longitude as fractional
       degrees like this:

       DD.DD,DD.DD (for example 51.1,-0.4).

       Neither format is particularly user-friendly, and the use  of  specific
       cities is recommended in most cases.



       Times  of  full  moons,  etc., are accurate to within about ten minutes
       either way.

       Times of equinoxes should be accurate to within ten minutes either way,
       but  perihelion and aphelion are difficult to determine, and should not
       be relied on to more than the nearest hour (although it's  not  obvious
       why one would need to know this information with such precision).



TIMEZONE AND DAYLIGHT SAVINGS
       By  default,  solunar  will  treat  all times as local to the specified
       city, or to the home local if no city is given. Daylight  savings  time
       will  always  be used at times when it is in effect. Consequently there
       can be discontinuities in the printed results when moving from  a  time
       when DST is in effect to one where it is not -- this is not an error.

       If  the  --utc  option is given, then all times are read and written as
       UTC (GMT, essentially) times. solunar cannot read times in one zone and
       write  them  in another -- it is not a timezone converter. Moreover, it
       is not possible to specify a particular timezone, but disable  the  use
       of  DST  corrections.   solunar relies on the underlying Unix system to
       provide meaningful timezone and DST data; solunar does  not  provide  a
       way to override the system, should it prove innacurate.


EXAMPLES
       solunar -c london
              Get a summary of data for London, for the current day



       solunar -c paris -d 'aug 2'
              Get  a summary for Paris, on the second of August in the current
              year



       solunar --list-moon-events -d 'jan 1 2012'
              Get a list of full and new moons, etc., for the year 2012.  Note
              that  the month and day are ignored in this case, but do need to
              be specified because solunar needs a  complete  date  to  parse.
              Note  that  no  location  need be specified, as these events are
              location-independent.




BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       At present, solunar is English-only in its output, and  locale-specific
       in  its  input. The latter means that month names, for example, have to
