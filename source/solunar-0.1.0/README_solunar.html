<h1>Solunar</h1>

<code>solunar</code> is a command-line utility for calculating 
sun- and moon-related information, such as rises and sets, apogees, 
and full moons. It also displays common festival days whose dates
vary from year to year, such as Easter.
<p/>
<code>solunar</code> is intended to be used in scripts, so it's output 
is designed to be easily parsed, rather than nicely presented. But it is
tolerably human-readable.
<p/>
For full details of operation, see 
the <a href="solunar.man.html">solunar man page</a>.

<h2>Building and installing</h2>

<code>solunar</code> is written in plain old C and has a plain old
Makefile. It should build on most modern Linux/Unix systems with 
the GNU C compiler (it does use some GNU-specific code). For 
Windows, <code>solunar</code> builds cleanly, and has been tested,
under Cygwin with gcc-4.0. The program uses the Unix-specific locale
database for timezone and DST information. Consequently, it won't 
build or run with MinGW on Windows. Sorry.
<p/>
The program consists of one binary, and an optional man page. Install
by copying them wherever you like.

<h2>Disclaimers, etc</h2>

I've originally wrote this program for predicting animal feeding habits,
for the purposes of photography. Some animals emerge from cover 
only to feed, and 
there's some evidence that feeding habits are influenced
by the position of the sun and/or moon. The algorithms I used are most
taken from Jean Meeus' publications, and have proven accurate enough
for my purposes. However, I really don't recommend using this program
for anything critical. 
<p/>
The code is distributed according to the GPL. Please feel free to use
for any purpose, but at your own risk.
