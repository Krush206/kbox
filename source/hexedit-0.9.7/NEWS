   I'm making a list of things I need to do here so I don't forget.

   - Redo input processing.  In multiple places I get input and do
     basically the same thing each time.  Make one generic routine to
     process input.
   - Redo Search popup window.  It's ugly, and I don't feel I can add 
     seach/replace without changing it enough that re-writing it would
     be easier.  
   - Use the new generic popupError window for errors, since I use this
     all over the place, and it all is basically cut and paste.
   - Fix Help screen so that resizing window works.

  As of version 0.9.3, Viewing and editing fixed disks under Linux works!
Currently, this is only for disks up to 4.2 gigs, but this is being worked
on.  It works on OpenBSD as well.
  I'm still looking for more stories on how hexedit saved the day,
especially situations where hexedit was just a small part of a larger
solution.  I want to include these in the manual.
