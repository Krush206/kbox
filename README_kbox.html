<h2>KBOX environment variable</h2>

Running kbox_shell sets the environment variable $KBOX to point to the
directory containing the bin directory containing the kbox_shell binary.
That is, if if kbox_shell is /my_path/bin/kbox_shell, $KBOX will be 
set to /my_path/. This is, in effect, the root of the kbox installation.
Many of the kbox scripts and binaries use this variable to locate other
standard directories -- home, etc, and so on. The supplied binaries
are only ordinary, complied ARM executables. They do not need to be invoked
with kbox_shell as a wrapper around bash. However, if they are invoked
directly, certain important files or directories may not be found.

<h2>$HOME and username</h2>

With kbox, $HOME is derived from the terminal emulator
app's user name (as stock Android has no concept of user credentials,
lacking an <code>/etc/passwd</code> or similar).
In fact, user ID itself is a dubious concept in Android.
I believe that the 
stock Android implementation of <code>getpwuid</code> (the function
that maps a numeric user ID onto user account details simply synthesize
the details from the numeric ID. In any event, your home directory is
likely to be something like <code>$KBOX/home/app_58<code>, and your
user name <code>app_58</code>. The user name is used when connecting to
services like <code>ssh</code>.  

<h2>ssh (client)</h2>

Provided by dropbear. Standard build. Keys will be cached in $HOME/.ssh in
the usual way. No non-standard arguments need be used, but bear in mind
that you'll have to specify a specific user for the remote service because
the Android user ID is arbitrary in a non-rooted device.

<h2>scp (client)</h2>

Provided by dropbear. Standard build. scp uses a hard-coded path to the ssh
utility, which will be wrong for kbox. I have renamed the binary scp.bin,
and created a script called scp that will run scp.bin with the -S switch,
overriding the location of the ssh utility.

<h2>ssh (server)</h2>

This is a somewhat modified version of dropbear. The original modification
was by Jakob Blomer, to account for the fact that Android has no 
<code>/etc/passwd</code>. I have further modified the program to launch
<code>kbox_shell</code> (and therefore the busybox shell) instead of
the Android shell. 
<p/>
There is a script <code>ssh_daemon.sh</code> that will launch the
ssh server with the appropriate arguments, specifying user credentials
and port number on the command line. As always, the port number must
be above 1024 for non-root usage. In addition, the user ID (specified
by the -U argument) <i>must</i> be the user ID of the terminal emulator
app running the script. <code>ssh_daemon.sh</code> takes care of thse
issues, and can be used as a template for more appropriate customization.
Note that this script sets the current username as the password, which
isn't hugely secure.
<p/>
(NB: 'FIXME' messages in the log output are from Google's rather 
incomplete implementation of the C library).
<p/>
In order to connect to the sshd server run as described above, clients
need to specify the port number on the command line (e.g., <code>
-p 1027</code>).

<h2>scp (server)</h2>

I haven't yet been able to figure out how to implement the server side
of an scp operation. I suspect the problem is (again) port numbers. 
The ssh server will accept an incoming scp request, but it doesn't seem
to get any further.

<h2>rsync(client)</h2>

Standard build. rsync can be used as a client with the default use of
ssh to start the server on the remote system. Or it can communicate
with a stand-alone <code>rsync</code> server, if a port number is
specified on the command line. 

<h2>rsync(server)</h2>

rsync can be run as a server by using daemon mode. This mode does not
require any other dameon processes (e.g., sshd) to be running on the device.
The command line is:

<pre>
% rsync --daemon --config [config_file] --port [port] --no-detach \
  --log-file /dev/null 
</pre>

You don't need to redirect the log to <code>/dev/null</code> -- but the
standard log location won't work, so you'll have to send it somewhere.
The config_file specifies what files will be made available in what
modes, and how they will be identified by the client. A sample config
file is provided in $KBOX/etc/rsyncd.conf. This config makes all files
available, read/write, under the identifier 'all'. The client will
do transfers like this:

<pre>
% rsync --port [device_ip]::all/path/to/file [local_path]
</pre>

This is essentiall the normal usage of rsync as a client, except that
the path is prefixed ':all', and the port number is given explicitly.
<p/>
Note that the rsync daemon will access only to the same files as the 
terminal emulator has, in an unrooted device.
<p/>
It might be convenient to have the rsync daemon launched by ssh daemon,
as is usual on desktop Linux distributions. In such a case, it would not
be necessary to run the rsync daemon separately if the ssh daemon were
already running.
<p/>
Unfortunately, there is a problem with port numbers. When rsync is run on
the client, it will use (by default) ssh to start the remote server, with
default port number. But we can't use the default port number if
we're not running as root (as explained above). So we have to use the 
rsync <code>-e</code> switch 

<h2>terminfo</h2>

A number of utilities need a terminfo (terminal control codes) database.
This can be obtained from desktop Linux distributions but, for this 
application, you probably don't need all the different terminals, just
the ones you expect to use. I have extracted <code>u/unknown</code> and
<code>l/linux</code> as the bare minimum. Most applications that
need to read terminfo will look at an environment variable TERMINFO
for its location. I have created the terminfo directory as
$KBOX/etc/terminfo, and set the environment variable in the login
profile.

<h2>vim</h2>
XXX Now an optional package
I got a pre-compiled version of vim from <a href="http://credentiality2.blogspot.com/2010/08/native-vim-for-android.html">here</a>.
vim needs TERMINFO set and, in order to use its more complex features,
it needs a variable VIMRUNTIME pointing to its own installation. I have
created a script that runs the vim binary, setting the appropriate
variables.

<h3>file</h2>

'file' is renamed 'file.bin', and a script 'file' runs file.bin with the
environment variable MAGIC pointing to the magic number file location.


<h2>Helper scripts</h2>

The following scrips start server daemons, using port numbers specified
in <code>$KBOX/etc/kbox_ports.sh</code>. These are provided for convenience,
and may well need to be customized.

<pre>
rsync_daemon.sh
telnet_daemon.sh
ssh_daemon.sh
</pre>
