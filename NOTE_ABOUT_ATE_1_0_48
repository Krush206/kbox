The directory app contains the original Java app from Jack Palovich,
modified for this application. app_1_0_48_2 contains the latest version
of the terminal app, again modified. However, note that the rest
of the build scripts in the source directory are set to put their
output into somewhere under ./app, not ./app_1_0_48_2. So if this
directory is cleaned out, or modifications are made to kbox_shell, etc.,
some manual updates will be necessary.
